Even filling out a form by hand with the Apple Pencil because it's quicker and easier than typing. To me this should all be part of any app named ?Fill and Sign? that runs on a device using Apple Pencil!

In Acrobat, Adobe extends the functionality of Protected View beyond blocking write-based attacks that attempt to execute malicious code on your computer system using the PDF file format to read-based attacks that attempt to steal your sensitive data or intellectual property via PDF files. Just like Protected Mode, Protected View confines the execution of untrusted programs (for example, any PDF file and the processes it invokes) to a restricted sandbox to avoid malicious code using the PDF format from writing to or reading from your computer's file system. Protected View assumes all PDF files are potentially malicious and confines processing to the sandbox unless you specifically indicate that a file is trusted.","Acrobat features and functionality","0","NA"

Throughout this journey, we have continually strengthened or added to financial and pre-financial objectives and established ourselves as leaders in integrating economic, social and environmental performance into the overall assessment and management of business success. In January 2022, we committed to achieving net zero emissions across our entire value chain by 2030, 20 years earlier than planned. We are therefore bringing forward our 20-year commitment. The next interim milestone on our journey to Net Zero is 2023, the year SAP aims to achieve carbon neutrality in its own operations, two years earlier than the original goal. This includes all direct (Scope 1), indirect (Scope 2), and certain value chain categories (Scope 3) carbon emissions, such as business air travel, commuting, and external data centers (co-sites and hyperscalers). However, we can significantly improve our decarbonization potential if we strengthen our efforts throughout the value chain. In 2020, gross carbon emissions amounted to 10,688 kilotonnes (kt) across SAP's value chain (including upstream and downstream emissions), compared to 441 kt of gross emissions for its own operations (see 2022 Integrated Report).","Sustainability: our policies, codes and commitments, Frequently Asked Questions","1","CFOs Turn On Sustainability Reporting and ESG Metrics in Enterprise Software Suites, social and environmental performance in the overall evaluation and management of the company's success, SAP Accelerates Climate Protection to Achieve Carbon-Neutrality by 2023, carbon neutrality in its own operations, Integrated report 2022"

"Zoom","https://zoom.us/pricing","What is the difference between Zoom Rooms and a Meeting?","Zoom Meetings (mobile and desktop client): This is the tool that users use every day to join meetings from their home or work computer or mobile device. Zoom Meeting is a desktop and smartphone application designed for a user account on user-assigned devices (e.g. your mobile device, tablet, or desktop device). The device on which the Zoom Meeting app is installed is not intended to be a shared resource, it is associated with an individual. Zoom Meetings is available alongside a user's other apps (e.g. email, calendar, photos, etc. on their device). With Zoom Meetings, it is therefore the user's Zoom environment and profile. For example, Zoom Meeting will include the user's chat groups, individual chat messages, favorite contacts list, Zoom Phone number, call history, and other user-level settings and information. Zoom for Home is part of the Zoom Meetings app. Zoom for Home allows any Zoom user to deploy a personal collaboration device for video meetings, phone calls, interactive whiteboards and annotations. Unlike a mobile device, tablet, or laptop running the Zoom app (one of many apps), Zoom for Home is installed on a personal device dedicated to Zoom's software. Zoom Rooms: Zoom Rooms is designed to run on hardware and devices dedicated to shared space meeting environments (like conference rooms), and is ideal for group collaboration. Zoom Rooms is a shared environment dedicated to communications and collaboration, using a single, standardized interface. This ensures users always work the same way no matter which room they enter, helping to minimize errors (an essential consideration when you think about meeting rooms shared by different collaborators with varying technical skills). Users can schedule the room using booking tools and can join meetings with one click. Zoom Rooms moves beyond traditional conference rooms and can be deployed in open spaces, including interactive whiteboards with video enabled, and can even offer value-added services, such as digital signage for corporate communications and brands or room schedulers for managing room reservations. Zoom Rooms are IT-managed resources designed to be the only application installed on a system. It is also linked to a calendar that can be modified by others. Zoom Rooms can offer a large number of displays, calculators, audio, cameras, captures, room controls and touch display controllers to join and manage meetings with integrated HD audio and video. So Zoom Rooms audio and video experiences can be easily deployed for 1-2 person rooms, breakout rooms, and lock-up rooms, and customized for large boardrooms, broadcast studios, and custom training rooms. Zoom Meetings (mobile and desktop client) and Zoom Rooms work together to emphasize that they are part of one large interconnected platform, Zoom.","Individuals and businesses, Frequently asked questions","0","NA"

This is a 3-Step process. Cisco supports four different authenticators : Duo, MS Authenticator, Google Authenticator and Authy, with Duo being preferred. To begin, download any of the supported authenticator apps and click ?Next? after being prompted to setup MFA during your login process. Scan the QR code using the authenticator app on your phone or enter the code manually into the app. Confirm the registration using the time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) and click ?Verify?. Option 2 - Proactively set up MFA in Profile Manager To setup MFA without waiting to be prompted/required, you may login to Profile Manager. To begin, login to Profile Manager and look for the pop-up or banner suggesting you configure MFA. Alternatively, navigate to the Security Tab and look for the ?Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)? setting. Enable the MFA setting in the Security Tab - this will initiate a similar process as ?Option 1? above. Download your preferred authenticator app - Duo (preferred), MS Authenticator, Google Authenticator, or Authy. Scan the QR code using the authenticator app on your phone or enter the code manually into the app. Confirm the registration using the time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) and click ?Verify?. After completing these steps, MFA will be activated for the account, and it will be required at any future login as an additional authentication method.

Once a Producer of STIX feeds content, a vendor providing a Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), a vendor providing a Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) tool, a vendor that provides threat mitigation systems (TMS), or a vendor that provides threat detection systems (TDS) executes the steps outlined, demonstrates successful interoperability, and documents such, that supplier may submit a statement to OASIS testifying to the self-certification. We are using TMS to refer to tools such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. We are using TDS to refer to tools such as intrusion detection software and web proxies. The self-certification process is intended to be policed by market forces. If a vendor or supplier self-certifies and is shown to be misrepresenting its products the OASIS Community will remove the vendor from the STIX/TAXII 2 compatible products list after verification of the claim.

"IBM","https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/faq","What are the criteria for adding a new STIX Domain Object (SDO)?","SDOs are used to represent independent concepts. An item becomes an SDO when it is expected to evolve on its own outside the context of any other objects. In other cases, objects become SDOs when there are multiple relationships between it and other SDOs, when a third-party needs to add relationships to/from that SDO and other SDOs, and when you need to express confidence on the object separately from the other objects it might be embedded in. New SDOs should be proposed as extension objects and may be submitted to the CTI Common Objects repository for development and testing.","STIX 2 Core Design Principles","0","NA"
"IBM","https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/faq","Why are some relationships ?embedded? and others are ?external??","External relationships (represented using an SRO) are used whenever third-parties might want to add to the relationship and/or to express an independent confidence assertion on the relationship. For example, the relationship between an Indicator and a Malware object is represented as an external relationship because you might only be sure to a medium degree of confidence that the Indicator is effective in detecting the Malware without false-negatives. Embedded relationships (represented using a property in an object with the ID of another object) are used when the relationship is a fact about the object. For example, the Producer that created an indicator is not up for debate; it's definitely from a particular Producer and they know that they created the SDO. Similarly, the contents of a Report are what they are. If later on it's determined that the Report should have different contents, it can be updated by the original Producer, but applying confidence or allowing third parties to arbitrarily add new objects to an existing Report doesn't make sense.","STIX 2 Core Design Principles","0","NA"
"IBM","https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/faq","When are IDs in UUIDv4 format vs UUIDv5?","First, to explain the differences between UUIDv4 and UUIDv5: UUIDv4 is randomly generated, so each UUIDv4 ID is essentially just an ID that you can assign to any object you want. UUIDv5 is a hash-based ID, where the ID is generated from the object that you want to ID. UUIDv5s should be used for SCOs that do not vary between generating systems. For example, an IPv4 address should have a single UUIDv5-style identifier, so that IPv4 address objects do not proliferate for the same IP address. However, for IPv4 localhost you may wish to use UUIDv4. STIX 2.1 introduced UUIDv5 for SCOs. STIX Domain Objects, STIX Relationship Objects, STIX Meta Objects, and STIX Bundle Object should continue to use UUIDv4. UUIDv5 could be used for SROs and SDOs as described in section 2.9 of the specification.","Specific STIX 2 Design Decisions","0","NA"

"IBM","https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/faq","Why can't Data Markings be versioned?","Data markings are applied to objects by referencing the ID of the data marking from the object. For example, to say a Campaign is marked with a copyright statement, the Campaign would have the ID of the Data Marking representing the copyright statement in its list of data markings (object_marking_refs). Because IDs are not specific to a single version of an object, the community felt that data markings should not be versionable. Making data markings versioned would allow producers to change the data markings and have that change automatically applied to any objects already referencing that marking.","Specific STIX 2 Design Decisions","0","NA"
"IBM","https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/faq","Are Cyber Observables objects top-level objects?","IN STIX 2.0, they were not. There were several considerations that led to this decision. Unlike the other higher-level STIX Domain Objects (e.g,Threat Actor, Campaign, etc.), Cyber Observables are almost exclusively machine produced and therefore not intended to be globally unique. Accordingly, Cyber Observables do not have the same requirements as the SDOs in terms of needing capabilities such as versioning and confidence. In addition, given their nature as elements that provide supporting evidence to other SDOs such as Observed Data, Cyber Observables do not require the ability to support the creation of non-factual (i.e., asserted) relationships via the STIX Relationship Objects. These factors, and also the desire for a more streamlined data model (as having Cyber Observables as top-level objects would significantly increase the number of such objects in STIX), led to the decision to use Cyber Observables in an embedded form rather than making them top-level objects. In STIX 2.1, after much discussion, STIX Cyber Observerable Objects (SCOs) were promoted to top-level objects. The STIX 2.0 specification made it difficult to defined a cyber observable just once (e.g., an IPv4 address) and use it in many different contexts.  Addtionally, as top-level objects, they can also be used in relationships, which was determed to be desirable. It is still possible to represent Cyber-observable Objects using the method described for STIX 2.0, but this method has been deprecated.","Specific STIX 2 Design Decisions","0","NA"

For example, the Malware stub can be used to provide malware names and descriptions in STIX 2.0 (useful for high-level threat intel and IOC sharing) but does not have capabilities to represent malware analysis data. Marking them as stub objects was intended to clearly demonstrate that these objects are not complete (due to time and resource constraints) and will be enhanced in future releases of STIX.

"IBM","https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/faq","Why are Note and Opinion separate objects?","The TC had an extensive discussion on the topic, including a ballot, and concluded that the use cases were sufficiently different to warrant separate objects. While the Note and Opinion objects bear significant architectural similarity, the underlying semantics (driven by their respective use cases) were such that making them separate SDOs was the logical choice. The Note object should be used to provide additional details or further analysis on an object. The Opinion object should be used to provide an opinion on the correctness of another object. Still wondering which to use? Do you want to provide a value on a scale from ?strongly disagree? to ?strongly disagree? about the object you're talking about?

For example, with stub objects the TC will more than likely make forward and backward-breaking changes, but these objects are marked as such and should not be considered stable. Other forward or backward breaking changes will be done carefully and only when the TC deems that the justification of doing so justifies the potential impact on implementers.","Specific STIX 2 Design Decisions","0","NA"

"IBM","https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/faq","Why did the TC not use normative text to describe a material change in versioning?","The reason the TC selected this wording is because it is not possible to create formal definition of a ?material change? based on STIX itself. You can't base a material change based on the number of properties that have changed. There may not be a correlation between the number of properties changed and whether or not those changes are material. Since one can't create a formal definition for a material change based on STIX itself, it makes little sense to have a formal normative statement like MUST or SHOULD around its usage. The OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) TC supports automated information sharing for cybersecurity situational awareness, real-time network defense, and sophisticated threat analysis.

The risk score is a normalized value that is produced from processing the threat intelligence information available to IBM, including internet scans and spam collection from across the globe. At a high level, this score reflects the potential maliciousness and risk of that IP. As an example, an IP that is identified as sending a high volume of spam frequently has a high risk score; this score decreases over time if the IP becomes less active in its spam output, either by volume or by frequency.","Section 3: About the threat information","0","NA"

The API provides contextual information for a wide range of threat intelligence, including synthesized collections of information focused on specific actors, threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities. The API supports JSON documents through a RESTful API, and STIX documents via the TAXII protocol. It is intended for clients needing all current and actionable indicators, and may be used with firewalls, intrusion prevention devices, web proxies, security monitors, and general-purpose servers. It provides full access to the X-Force Exchange platform for further research into specific indicators, threat hunting, or other indicator-based security analysis. It is suitable for integration in security operations centers (SOCs) and managed security service provider (MSSP) use cases. The offering provides access to IP and URL by category feeds, IP and URL reports, and vulnerability feeds, as well as all TAXII feeds. IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence API delivers programmatic access to the following threat intelligence: Collections. Curated threat intelligence, such as campaigns, actors, third-party threats (TTPs), and more IP reputation.

If it is wanted to work with the files, these can be imported into Schematics at run time into /tmp or persisted in /tmp/.schematics . Only files less than 10 MB are persisted between job runs. When creating Schematics workspaces or actions IBM Cloud Schematics clones a copy of the Terraform, or Ansible template from your Git repository and stores in a secured location. Before the template files are saved, Schematics analyses the content             and files considered malicious or vulnerable are removed. An allowlist is used to allow only authorized files.

However, when you build production workloads in the cloud, you most likely have multiple IBM Cloud services             and resources that are used by different teams. With resource groups, you can organize multiple services in your account and bundle them under one common view and billing process. To allow your team to work with these resources, you can assign             IAM access policies to a resource group that allows them to view and manage the resources within a resource group. For example, you have a team A that is responsible to manage an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster, and another team B that develops serverless apps with IBM Cloud© Functions. Both teams use IBM Cloud Schematics workspaces to manage their             Cloud resources. To help ensure workspace and resource isolation, you create a resource group for each team. Then, you assign the required permissions to each resource group. For example, the Manager service access role to             all workspaces in resource group A, but Reader access to the workspaces in resource group B.","NA","0","NA"

To keep this benefit, you must maintain an on-going paid Founders membership without interruption and that requires, as examples, that you keep your payment information current and make timely payments, and that you use the service in accordance with the terms of use. If for any reason your paid Founders membership ends, you make a membership plan modification, downgrade or if there is a termination, the benefit is forfeited and cannot be restarted. This benefit is only available to NVIDIA GeForce NOW users who are billed by NVIDIA's designated merchant of record in the US, Canada, UK and members of the European Union, is not transferable, and cannot be replaced for cash or credit. #container-0c0d6ad3f1 { } /* Mobile: up to 639px */ @media only screen and (max-width: 639px) { #container-0c0d6ad3f1 { } } /* Tablet: 640px to 1023px */ @media only screen and (min-width: 640px) and (max-width: 1023px) { #container-0c0d6ad3f1 { } } /* Laptop: 1024px to 1349px */ @media only screen and (min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1349px) { #container-0c0d6ad3f1 { } } /* Desktop: 1350px and up */ @media only screen and (min-width: 1350px) { #container-0c0d6ad3f1 { } }","Ultimate Memberships, Founders Memberships","0","NA"

When someone is removed from your organization, the tasks, projects, messages, files, and comments the person created will remain intact, but their assigned tasks will be left unassigned. To ensure no tasks go unaccounted for, it is a good idea to go into the person's My Tasks and reassign their tasks before deprovisioning them.

Additionally, if the user does not have an alternative email address associated with their Asana user account, deprovisioning them from your organization may result in them being locked out of Asana. To remove somebody from an organization, the following must be true: You must be an organization member You and the person you would like to remove must belong to the same team If you are not in the same team or already have removed someone from the team, invite the person into a team for the sole purpose of removing them from your organization immediately after.

"Airbnb FAQ","https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/how-aircover-for-hosts-works-469","How AirCover for Hosts works","Home Top-to-bottom protection is always included and free, whenever you host. By Airbnb on Dec 1, 2025 AirCover for Hosts provides protection every time you welcome guests. It includes guest identity verification, reservation screening, $1 million USD Host liability insurance, and $3 million USD Host damage protection, with protection for your valuables, parked cars, and boats on your property. Guest identity verification Our community is rooted in trust. That's why all booking guests must complete our identity verification process. When we verify a guest's identity, we verify certain personal information, such as their legal name, address, phone number, or other contact details. Once a guest has been verified, they'll get an identity verified badge. This is shown as a red badge with a checkmark next to their profile photo. In addition, we may run background checks on US-based guests. Get more details about guest identity verification. Reservation screening technology Our Community Disturbance Policy prohibits unauthorized and disruptive parties. We use proprietary reservation screening technology to help enforce that policy and reduce the chance of disruptive parties. The system looks at a range of factors to determine whether a booking should be blocked. These include the type of listing being booked, the duration of the stay, the distance to the listing from the guest's location, and whether the booking is last minute, among many more signals. Get more details about reservation screening technology. Host damage protection Host damage protection, a part of AirCover for Hosts, includes these protections if a guest doesn't pay for damage they cause to your home or belongings while staying at your place. $3 million USD damage protection: This includes both your home and its contents. Art and valuables protection: We protect fine art, jewelry, and collectibles, which may be reimbursed if damaged. Auto and boat protection: We provide damage protection for cars, boats, and other watercraft that you park or store at your property. Pet damage protection: We pay for damage done by four-legged guests. Deep cleaning: We reimburse for extra cleaning services required to remove stains and smoke odors. Income loss protection: We reimburse you for lost income if you cancel confirmed Airbnb bookings due to guest damage. Get more details about Host damage protection. Submit reimbursement request Simple reimbursement If a guest damages your place or belongings, you (or a co-host with full-access permissions acting on your behalf) can visit our Resolution Center to submit a reimbursement request and track the process from submission through payout. Your request will first be sent to the guest. If the guest does not respond or pay within 24 hours, you'll be able to involve Airbnb. Host liability insurance Host liability insurance, part of AirCover for Hosts, provides hosts with up to $1 million USD in coverage in the rare event that a guest is hurt or their belongings are damaged or stolen while staying at your place. People who help you host, like co-hosts and cleaners, are included in this coverage. Host liability insurance covers you if you're found legally responsible for: Bodily injury to a guest (or others). Damage to or theft of property belonging to a guest (or others). Damage caused by a guest (or others) to common areas, like building lobbies and nearby properties. Use our liability insurance intake form to file a claim. We'll send the information you provide to our trusted third-party insurer, who will assign your claim to a representative. They'll resolve your claim according to the terms of the insurance policy. Get more details about Host liability insurance. Submit a claim Airbnb Services in your home Similar to how you're covered by Host liability insurance through AirCover for Hosts, service hosts are covered by Airbnb's Experiences & Services liability insurance.

Ground rules for guests Airbnb requires all guests to follow ground rules. They must treat your space with respect, follow your house rules, communicate promptly if issues arise, and leave your home in a state that doesn't require excessive cleaning. Every guest who books agrees to these ground rules before making a reservation. If a guest doesn't follow ground rules, you can report this by contacting Airbnb Support or giving the guest a low rating for cleanliness or house rules during the reviews process. Guests who repeatedly break standard house rules could be suspended or removed from Airbnb if the issues persist. House rules are enforceable under ground rules, and allow you to set expectations with guests that are specific to your place. You can choose from our list of standard house rules regarding: Pets Events Smoking, vaping, and e-cigarettes Quiet hours Check-in and checkout times Maximum number of guests Commercial photography and filming If you have special instructions that aren't included in the standard house rules, you can write them under additional rules in your listing settings. For example, you might ask guests to close and lock all windows before they check out. Update your house rules Guest profiles and reviews Guests who book a reservation or join a trip are prompted to create a complete profile, with a photo and details about themselves, to help you get to know them before their stay. You can trust that guest reviews are based on real interactions since hosts and guests can only review each other after a reservation is complete. You can also ask guests questions and set expectations at any point before they come to stay. If you use Instant Book, you can choose to offer it only to guests who have completed at least one stay without incidents or low ratings. If you prefer manual booking requests, you can access guests' profiles and reviews before accepting a reservation. You can always cancel a reservation you reasonably believe will lead to a party as long as you follow our Host Cancellation Policy. If you're uncomfortable with a trip request, you can decline it as long as you follow our Nondiscrimination Policy. Want more support? Join your local Host Club to connect with other hosts.

"Airbnb FAQ","https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/how-much-does-airbnb-charge-hosts-288","How much Airbnb charges hosts","Home How much does Airbnb charge hosts? How much does Airbnb charge hosts? Understanding service fees can help you set a pricing strategy. By Airbnb on Nov 16, 2020 Updated Aug 25, 2025 Service fees help Airbnb support hosts and cover the cost of things like payment processing, marketing, and customer service. They're a percentage of your nightly price plus any fees you've added, like a cleaning fee. Service fees are deducted from your price to calculate your payout. There are 2 types of fee structures on Airbnb: split fee and single fee. Split fee Hosts and guests each pay their own service fees. A 3% host fee is deducted from your price to calculate your payout.* In addition, guests pay a 14.1% to 16.5% service fee on top of your price. This means you set one price but guests see and pay another. For example, if you set your price at $100 USD, you earn $97 and your guests pay about $115. Single fee A single service fee is deducted from your price to calculate your payout. It's typically 14 to 16%.** This means you set the price guests see and pay. For example, with a 15.5% single fee, if you set your price at $115, you earn $97.18 and your guests pay $115. The single fee is required for traditional hospitality listings, including most hotel listings and serviced apartments. Most hosts who use property management or channel management software are also on a single fee. Why does Airbnb charge service fees? Service fees help Airbnb run smoothly and support hosts. They cover the cost of things like: Processing guest payments Marketing listings to guests 24/7 customer support Where do I find the service fee? Open any booking on your calendar, or any transaction in your earnings dashboard, to see a price breakdown. You'll find the service fee on its own line. Learn more about service fees on the Help Center, which has articles on: Airbnb service fees Value Added Tax (VAT) Airbnb Experiences and Airbnb Services Service fee refunds for guests *Some pay more, including some hosts with listings in Italy and Brazil. **Hosts with super strict cancellation policies may pay a higher fee.

"Airbnb FAQ","https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/preparing-your-spaceand-your-guestsfor-emergencies-134","Preparing your space—and your guests—for emergencies","Home Plan ahead with these tips from global health and safety organizations. By Airbnb on Mar 5, 2020 As a host, you have a lot to remember and unless you make an effort to focus on home safety, things can get overlooked. From staying on top of basic tasks like replacing batteries to sharing an evacuation plan with your guests, we know how important it is for you to stay prepared in case of a fire, natural disaster, or other emergency. We've compiled some tips from the Global Disaster Preparedness Center, the American Red Cross, and other health and safety organizations, but it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with any rules and regulations specific to your region. Install smoke and carbon monoxide alarms You may already know about the dangers of a fire, but what about the threat of carbon monoxide (CO)? Many common household appliances—like gas stoves, water heaters, ovens, furnaces, and charcoal grills—can emit CO. The invisible, odorless, colorless gas can be dangerous and even lethal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Without proper inspection and ventilation, these appliances can cause dangerous gas buildup that can lead to serious health issues and even death. Help prevent CO poisoning by installing alarms near every sleeping area, as the CDC suggests. You can help prevent fires by installing smoke alarms on every level of your space and outside each sleeping area at a minimum, according to the American Red Cross. You can also buy combination alarms that work for smoke and CO. Be sure to update the amenities section of your listing description to let potential guests know that you've taken these steps to protect their safety. Help your guests understand the danger of CO poisoning Once you've installed carbon monoxide alarms, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the common sources of carbon monoxide and the telltale signs of CO poisoning: Signs of carbon monoxide poisoning include headaches, weakness, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. If you or your guests experience these and you suspect CO poisoning, the CDC recommends that you exit the building immediately and call 911. Your house manual is a great place to remind guests about why they should never use a grill or camp stove indoors, which includes garages and basements. This reminder is especially important in climates where your guests may be tempted to use stoves or ovens for warmth. You can explain the dangers of CO, and be sure to provide reliable sources of heat. In your house manual, you can communicate that if the CO alarm sounds, guests should follow a recommended safety protocol, like going outdoors immediately or moving near an open window or door if they can't get outside. Note: Some homes that don't have any fuel-burning appliances (i.e. homes that run entirely on electric) may not need CO alarms, but it's a good idea to contact your local fire department's non-emergency number to confirm. Build a maintenance schedule into your hosting routine Test your smoke and carbon monoxide alarms regularly. The CDC recommends checking or replacing the batteries when you change the time on your clocks each spring and fall. Most alarms should be replaced every five to 10 years, but check the manufacturer's instructions","NA","0","NA"
"Airbnb FAQ","https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/how-search-works-on-airbnb-460","How search works on Airbnb","Home Get tips for improving your ranking in search results. By Airbnb on May 11, 2022 Updated Nov 21, 2022 You've created and published your listing, and now you want people to check it out. How do they find it? Here are a few things you can do to improve your search ranking. Understand the basics Airbnb's search algorithm uses many factors to determine the order listings appear in search results. Not every factor is weighed equally. The price, quality, and popularity of a listing heavily influence how a listing shows up. The algorithm prioritizes the total price of a listing before taxes (including fees and discounts), and the quality of a listing, compared to similar listings in the area. A listing's photos, guest reviews, and other characteristics can help determine its quality. Setting a competitive price and maintaining high quality can help improve your ranking, because listings offering the best value in any given region tend to rank higher in search results. Strive for popularity Airbnb's algorithm evaluates your listing's popularity using a wide range of info. This includes how often guests book your listing, visit your listing page, and add your listing to their wish lists. More popular listings tend to rank higher in search results. To help spark guests' interest, we recommend that you: Offer amenities guests want, such as high-speed wifi, self check-in, and free parking. Describe the unique characteristics of your space with specific details that let guests know exactly what to expect. Feature high-quality photos that set an inviting scene. High-quality photos may improve your prominence within a category. Open more availability Airbnb's algorithm factors in your listing's availability, your response times to inquiries, and how often you accept reservations. The more open dates you offer on your calendar, the more likely your listing will meet a guest's search criteria and appear in their search results. Actions you can take to improve your listing's search ranking: Respond to reservation requests within 24 hours. Avoid frequently declining reservation requests. Use Instant Book, so guests can find your listing when they filter their search results for that option. This feature lets guests book your place instantly (without the need for you to accept their requests), speeding up your response times. Reduce the number of restrictions, like the minimum and maximum length of stays, you put on bookings. Offer great hospitality Your ability to set guest expectations in your listing description, then meet or exceed them as a Host, typically improves your search ranking over time. Providing accurate details about your place and clearly communicating with guests can lead to higher ratings and reviews of their stays with you. It can also help you avoid customer service complaints, which can negatively affect your listing's ranking. The algorithm also considers whether you're a Superhost—our term for a highly rated, experienced Host—or if you're meeting some or all of the requirements to become one. The requirements include things like responding quickly to guest booking inquiries and keeping cancellations (by you) to a minimum. Guests have the option to filter their search results to access only listings offered by Superhosts.

"Airbnb FAQ","https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/plan-ahead-for-weather-emergencies-684","Plan ahead for weather emergencies","Home Prepare your guests and your space for hurricanes, tornadoes, and extreme heat. By Airbnb on Jun 26, 2024 Updated Aug 8, 2024 Being prepared for severe weather helps protect you, your guests, and your property. The health-focused relief and development organization Americares offers these tips for supporting guests and reducing property damage during hurricanes, tornadoes, and heat waves. Supporting guests Guests may be unfamiliar with the local climate and what to do in a weather emergency. Here are some ways to support them, according to Americares. Write down or print out important information and leave it in a prominent place. Emergency contacts: List phone numbers for police, fire, and ambulance services along with the national emergency line (such as 911, 999, or 112). Property address: Provide your place's full street address, major cross streets or landmarks, and the name of the neighborhood, district, or zone. Storm shelter: Note where to shelter in place during a tornado or hurricane, like the basement or an interior room with no windows or skylights. Map of the area: Identify potential evacuation routes, community evacuation shelters, and cooling centers. Note which locations allow pets. Account for seasonal weather in your listing, messages, and cancellation policy. House rules: Add basic details about the area's seasonal weather. For example, “Hurricane season is usually from June to November. Please follow weather reports and instructions issued by local officials.” Quick replies and scheduled messages: Use the tools in your Messages tab to save tips you can share when severe weather is forecast. For example, you could create a quick reply suggesting where to cool down during a heat wave. Cancellation policy: Severe weather may pose additional hazards for places without air conditioning and unique stays like campers, tents, and treehouses. Offering a flexible cancellation policy gives guests more leeway to plan around forecasts. The cancellation policy you select for your listing generally determines guest refunds for canceled reservations, unless you and the guest agree otherwise. If a large-scale event at the reservation location prevents or legally prohibits a reservation from being completed, Airbnb's Major Disruptive Events Policy may apply. When the Major Disruptive Events Policy applies, you can cancel a reservation without fees or adverse consequences, and the listing's calendar will be blocked for those dates. Guests with impacted reservations can also cancel and receive a full refund. If you or your guests cancel a reservation that's covered by the policy, you will not receive a payout. Communicating with guests Americares suggests messaging your guests about weather advisories. You can remind them of local resources and share tips for protecting themselves during their stay. Messaging guests about hurricanes Messaging guests about tornadoes Messaging guests about extreme heat Reducing property damage Weather-resistant improvements can help reduce property damage during a hurricane or tornado and make your place more comfortable during a heat wave.

"Airbnb FAQ","https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/how-to-prepare-your-space-and-guests-for-wildfires-542","How to prepare your space and guests for wildfires","Home These expert tips can help you reduce risks and educate guests about safety. By Airbnb on Aug 5, 2022 Updated Aug 8, 2024 We take the safety of Hosts and guests seriously. Our Trust & Safety Advisory Coalition partnered with the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) to share these resources from its Ready, Set, Go! program. Though the program is US-based, its tips are relevant in many places affected by wildfires worldwide. Here are a few of the IAFC's suggestions for reducing risks and educating guests about wildfire safety. Reducing wildfire risks Planning ahead can help protect you, your guests, and your property. The IAFC suggests taking these steps: Remove overgrown vegetation within 30 feet (9 meters) of your house, garage, and other buildings on your property to help create defensible space. Use hard surfaces—like concrete, rock, or pavers—5 feet (1.5 meters) around the base of your home. Use fire-resistant, low-growing, herbaceous vegetation when planting in areas close to your home. Remove low-hanging branches to create at least 6 feet (2 meters) of distance between grasses, shrubs, and taller trees. Sign up for emergency alerts in your property's location to stay informed. Many local, regional, and national government agencies offer this service. Check their websites for details. Educating guests about wildfire safety Guests traveling from places that aren't typically affected by wildfires may not understand the risks. You can help them be prepared with these tips from the IAFC: Add basic information about the area's wildfire season and burn restrictions to your house rules. Display a list of local emergency contacts somewhere prominent in your space, like on the fridge or coffee table. Give guests a map of the area that clearly shows your property's address, nearby road names, multiple evacuation routes, and potential safe locations. Include the name of your neighborhood. Encourage guests to sign up for local emergency alerts and stay updated on fire activity, even if a wildfire isn't near your property. Let guests know they don't need to wait for an evacuation order to leave. They may need extra time to navigate the area if it's unfamiliar to them. For more resources about preparing for wildfires, you can reach out to your local fire department. If you're in the US, you can also check out Ready, Set, Go! to understand more about wildfires and create an action plan. Handling cancellations The cancellation policy you select for your listing generally determines guest refunds for canceled reservations, unless you and the guest agree otherwise. If a large-scale event at the reservation location prevents or legally prohibits a reservation from being completed, Airbnb's Major Disruptive Events Policy may apply. When the Major Disruptive Events Policy applies, you can cancel a reservation without fees or adverse consequences, and the listing's calendar will be blocked for those dates.

"Airbnb FAQ","https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/what-happens-when-guests-cancel-or-change-a-booking-426","What happens when guests cancel or change a booking?","Home Here's what to expect with your payout when trip plans change. By Airbnb on Jul 19, 2021 Updated Aug 24, 2022 Life is uncertain, and guests sometimes have to cancel or change their reservations. You may still receive payment—or what we call a payout—even if a guest cancels, depending on your cancellation policy and how far in advance guests cancel. Here's exactly what to expect if your guests cancel or change their booking, or if they request a partial refund. When a guest cancels their reservation If a guest cancels their booking, your cancellation policy applies. If you're owed a payout, the money will typically be sent to you 24 hours after your guest's scheduled check-in time. For example, if you have a firm cancellation policy, and your guest cancels less than seven days before check-in, you'll be paid 100% of your nightly price for all nights, minus any taxes and fees. We'll send this 24 hours after your guest's scheduled check-in time. You won't receive a cleaning, pet, or extra guest fee if your guest doesn't check in. You'll always be able to find a record of any payouts or adjustments in your transaction history. Learn more about how you get paid When a guest changes their reservation If a guest alters their booking, we'll typically send payment 24 hours after their new check-in time. If you're hosting longer stays, you'll receive a monthly payout for these reservations. For example, if you approve a change request for a guest to come for 10 days in August instead of 10 days in June, and they change with enough time that your cancellation policy doesn't apply, we'll send your payout 24 hours after your guest's new check-in time. If a guest changes their reservation while they're at your place, your future payouts may be affected. For example, if a guest checks in to your place for a 20-day reservation, we'd send your payout 24 hours after their check-in time. But if they have to cancel and leave on day 10, and you have a flexible cancellation policy, you'd be entitled to payment for each night they stay, plus one additional night. In this case, since you would've already received your full payout, your future payouts will be adjusted to cover the cost of the partial refund. When a guest requests a refund If a guest checks in to your place expecting an amenity, but it's missing or broken, they might ask for a partial refund. For example, if your hot tub is unexpectedly broken, and it's a main feature of your villa, your guest may contact you to request a partial refund. For this example as well, if you agree to a partial refund, your future payouts will be adjusted to cover the cost of the partial refund, since you would've already received your full payout. You may also reimburse guests through the Resolution Center. If you send payment that way, your future payouts wouldn't be affected. Protecting yourself from cancellations Of course, you can't control whether a guest has to cancel or change their reservation. But you can be sure you're comfortable with your settings by reading more about our guest cancellation policies and choosing the right one for you. It's also a great idea to do regular maintenance and communicate with guests at important moments, so you can be confident that your place will be ready to welcome guests—and you'll be able to help if anything goes wrong.

"Airbnb FAQ","https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/tips-to-help-prevent-parties-at-your-property-223","Tips to help prevent parties at your property","Home Get details about the global party ban and strategies for avoiding problems. By Airbnb on Jul 1, 2020 Updated Jul 25, 2022 Helping Hosts and guests stay safe is one of Airbnb's priorities. To help deter unruly behavior at properties listed on Airbnb, we prohibit disruptive parties and events, including open-invitation gatherings. Our global party and events ban has led to a 44% year-over-year drop in the rate of party reports since its implementation in August 2020. It's also been well-received by Hosts, community leaders, and elected officials. Whether you've hosted hundreds of times or you're just getting started, we want you to feel at ease welcoming guests into your space. Here are six steps you can take to discourage parties and reduce some related risks. 1. Learn how the ban works To help stop problems before they start, we encourage you to read our party and events policy. Some key points: Disruptive parties and events and open-invitation gatherings are not allowed. In certain countries and regions, we've implemented restrictions on some local bookings of entire home listings by guests under the age of 25 who have negative reviews or fewer than three positive reviews. We're removing the occupancy cap of 16 people—which we implemented in 2020 primarily in response to public health concerns related to COVID-19—in the coming months. Hosts of traditional hospitality venues, like boutique hotels, may allow appropriate events at their discretion. Hosts may not authorize a gathering that violates the policy. Airbnb may take action against guests and Hosts who violate our policies. 2. Set expectations with guests It's a good idea to update your listing description and house rules to let guests know what to expect before they book. Clarify whether you allow any guests who aren't included in the reservation on the premises, especially if your space can accommodate a lot of people or has a swimming pool or a large outdoor area. 3. Get to know your guests Communicating clearly with your guests is one way you can help keep yourself, your property, and your community safe. After you get a reservation request or a confirmed booking, review the guest's info and ask a few basic follow-up questions about their visit, such as: What's the purpose of your trip? Who else will be staying with you? Can you confirm you've read the house rules? This is also an opportunity to remind guests of anything you don't want them to forget or overlook, like quiet hours. You can share local laws or restrictions regarding noise, parking, and public health. 4. Be a good neighbor Let your neighbors know you're hosting guests. Consider leaving your contact info with one or more trusted neighbors and asking them to get in touch with you if any unexpected issues arise. If they have concerns, you can assure them that the overwhelming majority of guests do not cause problems. In fact, 99.92% of reservations worldwide on Airbnb had no reports of safety-related issues in 2021.* 5. Make yourself available to guests Even if you offer self check-in, you can still show your guests that you're available. Here's what you can do before, during, and after check-in: Let guests know how to contact you by phone in an emergency. You'll be better able to manage any incidents, and they'll appreciate a fast response. Offer to stop by—or send someone—if guests need anything. If you don't live nearby, it's smart to designate a property manager or Co-Host who can handle things in-person when necessary. 6. Take action if you have concerns If you believe a guest intends to throw a party, you can cancel the reservation prior to check-in without consequences. We will ask you to provide evidence supporting your decision, such as messages from your guest and other documentation. For example, let's say a guest who lives near your place books a last-minute, one-night stay on a weekend. They message you and ask about extra street parking for several friends—and you read another Host's review of the guest that mentions a party. If you share the guest's message and the review with us, you may be able to cancel the reservation without consequences. You may be able to cancel online if you have Instant Book turned on and haven't reached your limit of three cancellations per year. If the guest's check-in time is within 24 hours, you'll need to contact us to cancel the reservation. To learn more about safety and expectations for hosting, read our community policies. *Based on internal Airbnb data from January 1 to December 31, 2021.

"Airbnb FAQ","https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/six-ways-to-get-last-minute-bookings-701","Getting last-minute bookings","Home Six ways to get last-minute bookings Six ways to get last-minute bookings Adding discounts and allowing shorter stays can help fill your calendar. By Airbnb on Nov 11, 2024 Even the most popular listings have unexpected openings sometimes. Consider these six tips for attracting last-minute bookings and maximizing your earnings. 1. Add a last-minute discount Last-minute discounts help give guests an incentive to book. They apply to reservations booked 1 to 28 days before check-in. For discounts of 10% or more off your 60-day median price, guests see a special callout on your listing page and in search results. Your discounted price appears alongside your original one, which is crossed out. To add a last-minute discount: Go to the Pricing tab in your listing's calendar. Under More discounts, open Last-minute discounts. Enter the number of days before arrival, between 1 and 28. Enter the percentage discount you'd like to offer. You can adjust the discount based on when reservations are booked, raising it incrementally as the date gets closer, for example. Note that this discount isn't available when Smart Pricing is turned on. Add a discount 2. Allow shorter stays Guests looking for impromptu getaways may have only a day or two to travel. Lowering your minimum trip length gives them the option to book shorter stays, and that helps you reach last-minute travelers. To lower your trip minimum: Go to the Availability tab in your listing's calendar. Tap Minimum nights under Trip length. Edit the minimum trip length to the number of nights that works for you. Lower your trip minimum 3. Compare similar listings in your area Airbnb's compare similar listings tool can help you set a competitive price for unbooked nights. Check the average prices of similar listings in your area for the same dates and consider adjusting your nightly rate. To compare similar listings: Go to the Pricing tab in your listing's calendar. Select a date range of up to 31 days. Tap View similar listings. A map of your area will show average prices of similar listings nearby, based on factors like location, size, and amenities. Use the buttons on the map to show booked or unbooked listings. “I'm always checking that my pricing is competitive, so I want to see how much other hosts in my area are getting per night,” says Felicity, a Host Advisory Board member and Superhost in New South Wales, Australia. Compare similar listings 4. Adjust your nightly price Temporarily dropping your price for unbooked nights can encourage guests to book your home. Listings with prices lower than other similar listings nearby tend to rank higher in search results. You can always adjust your price again later as you welcome more guests and to meet your earnings goals. Adjust your price 5. Shorten advance notice Consider letting guests book closer to check-in to help fill your calendar during low season. You can choose a lead time as short as the same day, depending on how much time you need between a guest's booking and their arrival. “I understand what it's like to be traveling and need those accommodations last minute, so I don't like to put a cap on when a person can send in a booking request,” says Myranda, a Superhost in Little Rock, Arkansas. “Even if there's not someone booked for the very next day, I'll make sure the space is clean and ready to go.” To change your minimum lead time: Go to the Availability tab in your listing's calendar. Open Advance notice. Select the number of days that works for you. You can also allow requests with shorter notice than your minimum lead time. You'll be prompted to review and approve these requests. Shorten advance notice 6. Ask friends and family Reach out to your personal contacts through social media, email, or text, and let them know your home is available. Someone in your network might be inspired to book a spontaneous trip. As with hosting any other stay, clear communication is key—perhaps especially for last-minute bookings. If a guest books a reservation with less than 48 hours to check-in, they can select a check-in time outside of your typical check-in window. If your listing is Instant Book, you'll receive a booking inquiry. Be ready with clear check-in instructions, and let them know if you need more time between stays.

"Airbnb FAQ","https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/how-to-host-on-your-terms-290","Hosting on your terms","Home How to host on your terms How to host on your terms Host your space your way by adjusting settings and house rules. By Airbnb on Nov 10, 2020 Updated Nov 16, 2022 Welcoming people you've never met into your space might be new for you. To help you feel more comfortable hosting, Airbnb has settings and features that let you control how and when you host. From which spaces in your place are available to guests to the number of guests who can stay, you can tailor your booking settings based on your needs, availability, and preferences. If you're not sure how to choose your booking settings or create your house rules, don't worry. We'll guide you through the different options and provide a few examples of the ways you can host on your terms. Create a clear, detailed listing Your listing provides guests with a peek into your space, helping them get a better sense of your living arrangements and pricing before they make a reservation. When creating your listing, consider: What nightly rate and fees you want to charge: When hosting on Airbnb, you set the nightly rate you charge your guests. Your rates can be modified at any time before you accept a reservation and can vary from night to night and season to season. You can also choose to include extra fees for cleaning, additional guests, and more. Our pricing tips can help you set a competitive price. How many guests your space accommodates: In your listing, indicate the maximum number of guests you're willing to host at one time. Guests can only book your place if the total number of people in their group is the same or fewer than what you've set in your booking criteria. Which amenities are available to guests: Just because you have a grill or a washer and dryer doesn't mean you need to make them available. You can indicate the amenities at your place that guests can use, those they can't, and any that come with restrictions. For example, Brian, a Host in Newport, Rhode Island, writes in his listing description, “Guests may use my washer and dryer upon request.” Set your house rules House rules help you be clear about your hosting style and set expectations with guests. They also help guests decide up front if your place is right for them. Your house rules are now featured prominently in four places: on your listing page, when guests book your space, and in the Pack Your Bags email as well as the Arrival Guide guests receive ahead of their trip. With ground rules, anything you include in your standard house rules can be enforced. You can choose your standard house rules from a set of fixed options in the following areas: Pets Events Smoking, vaping, and e-cigarettes Quiet hours Check-in and checkout times Maximum number of guests Commercial photography and filming Like always, you can also add a written set of additional rules to accompany your standard house rules. Your additional rules should specify anything that's off-limits for guests, like a private balcony or personal storage closet. You can also include rules related to local and regional customs (such as staying quiet during the siesta) and requirements that aren't included in standard house rules (such as no shoes in the house). If you believe a guest violates your rules—either those you've selected or those you've written—contact Community Support. We'll support you if you need to cancel the reservation. Note: All house rules must align with Airbnb's policies and terms—including our terms of service and nondiscrimination policy. How to edit your house rules Choose your booking settings Use your calendar and booking settings to set your availability and identify the types of bookings you want to receive. When determining your booking settings, consider: Your availability: It's up to you to decide when you'd like to make your place available to guests. If you'll be out of town, hosting friends or family, or unable to host at certain times, you can block your calendar for specific dates. If you'd prefer to have more time to clean or take a break between guests, you can also set a standard preparation time before every booking to create a buffer between each stay. How guests can book: As a Host, you can choose how guests book your space: either by using Instant Book or sending a reservation request. Instant Book allows people who meet all of your guest requirements and agree to your house rules to instantly book your space for any available dates. With reservation requests, you review and accept each request individually. How long you want guests to stay: You can choose the minimum and maximum length of a stay at your place, subject to local laws. Some Hosts adjust their requirements based on seasonal demand, requiring a two-night or even one-week minimum during peak periods. Advance notice: Not sure when you'll be available to host in the future? No problem. Use your settings to control how far in advance you want to accept bookings. That way, guests can't make a reservation for dates that you're not ready to commit to. You can also set the amount of notice you need before guests arrive—for instance, you can use your settings to avoid same-day or next-day bookings if you prefer to have more notice before a guest arrives. Guest arrival and departure times: Late checkouts and early arrivals can interfere with other reservations, especially if you have back-to-back bookings. You can use your settings to establish guest arrival and departure times, and edit your listing to describe why it's important for guests to stick to these times (for example: ""The cleaner will arrive at 11 a.m.""). Remember, your booking settings can be adjusted at any time. It can also be helpful to routinely review your booking settings to ensure they match your current availability and hosting preferences. Host with confidence Hosts appreciate guests who treat their place as if it were their own. At Airbnb, we've implemented a number of policies and protections to help you attract guests who will be a good fit for your space. In addition to these protections, clear listing descriptions, detailed house rules, and up-to-date booking settings can help ensure your place is treated with respect, providing you with greater confidence and helping you create a better experience for your guests.

"Airbnb FAQ","https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/understanding-instant-book-17","Understanding Instant Book","Home Instant Book can simplify the booking process and help your listing stand out. By Airbnb on Dec 14, 2020 Updated May 1, 2024 Instant Book allows guests to immediately book your home for available dates. You don't need to review and accept each booking request individually, which saves time. Many guests also like the convenience Instant Book provides. How Instant Book works You can turn Instant Book on or off anytime. Update your booking settings in the Listings tab. When using Instant Book, all booking guests must go through Airbnb's identity verification process, agree to your house rules, and meet your guest requirements. You can set your requirements to offer Instant Book only to guests who have a positive track record. That means they've completed at least one stay and haven't received any negative reviews. If you require a government ID during an in-person check-in, or if it's a requirement where your property is located, you can request this from guests by messaging them through your Messages tab. You'll need to keep your calendar up to date when using Instant Book. Consider syncing your Airbnb calendar with any other calendars you use. This helps you avoid getting unexpected bookings or canceling a reservation due to a scheduling error, which could result in cancellation fees and other consequences. You can cancel a booking without consequences for valid reasons, like a guest making it clear they'll likely break one of your house rules. Keep in mind that you can never cancel for any reason that violates Airbnb's nondiscrimination policy. Why you might still get booking requests There are a few scenarios where you might get booking requests even when using Instant Book: Your calendar is out of date. You've recently canceled a reservation. A guest who doesn't meet your requirements may send a reservation request. You'll need to respond by accepting or declining the reservation, or messaging your prospective guests within 24 hours. Choose the booking setting that's right for you You control when and how guests book your place. While Instant Book offers efficiency and convenience, some Hosts may find booking requests work better for them. Choose a method that helps you avoid canceling on guests for preventable reasons.

Our founder and CEO Pavel Durov, who financed Telegram throughout most of its history, has outlined a strategy to make Telegram sustainable in this post. Following this plan, Telegram has implemented sustainable forms of monetization that prioritize its users: In 2021, Telegram launched Sponsored Messages – minimalist, privacy-conscious advertisements that can appear in certain public channels. In 2022, Telegram launched a Premium subscription which users can purchase to both support the app and unlock additional exclusive features. These revenue streams help us pay for infrastructure costs and developer salaries, however making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram.

We don't use your data for ad targeting, we don't sell it to others, and we're not part of any mafia family “family of companies.” Telegram only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich cloud service. For example, your cloud chats – so that you can access them from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts – so that you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on Telegram.

"Telegram","https://telegram.org/faq","Do you process take-down requests from third parties?","Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet. To do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal public content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, groups and channels) within the app. For example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots. Public content on Telegram, such as user-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers, is not part of the core Telegram UI. Whenever we receive a report regarding potentially illegal public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate. Please note that this does not apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech. For example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship. This goes against our founders' principles. While we do block terrorist (e.g. ISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.","General Questions","1","'Russia's Mark Zuckerberg' takes on the Kremlin, comes to New York | Mashable"

"Telegram","https://telegram.org/faq","Do you process data requests?","Secret chats use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don't have any data to disclose. To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure. Cloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. As a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data. Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression. Telegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world. To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user messages to third parties, including governments.

"Telegram","https://telegram.org/faq","Who can contact me?","People can contact you on Telegram if they know your phone number or if you message them first. If they don't know your phone number, they can find you in these cases: When you both are members of the same group. If you set a public username. Others can use Global Search and find you by your username. Telegram allows third-party services to send verification codes to their users via Telegram. These codes only appear in the verified 'Verification Codes' chat, and let you tap to instantly copy the code.  Services that do not specify a name or profile picture for their codes will appear with the default name and photo of 'Verification Codes'. If you receive a code in the 'Verification Codes' chat, it's probably because you requested to log in to a third-party service, like an external website, app or marketplace. It's also possible that someone else accidentally entered your phone number when logging in to another service. Either way, your Telegram account is completely safe — if you didn't request a code, simply tap on it and select 'Report', no need to do anything else. Third-party services determine which way your verification codes are sent – and Telegram is not able to control this or make a service aware of your preferences. Unlike SMS codes that frequently fail to arrive and can be interecepted, verification codes sent via Telegram are delivered instantly and are securely encrypted – making them safer and more reliable for both users and services. The 'Verification Codes' chat is only used for codes from third-party services. Login codes for your Telegram account itself are sent to the verified service notifications chat named 'Telegram' in your chat list and should never be shared with anyone, including other services or apps.

Read a message they sent you in a one-on-one chat. Broadcast a “typing…” status to their chat with you or to a group where you both are members.

Together with privacy settings for forwarded messages, this makes exchanging Telegram messages similar to talking face to face (without a tape recorder).

You can also pin important messages to the top of the screen so that all members can see them, including those who have just joined. Channels are a tool for broadcasting messages to large audiences. In fact, a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers. When you post in a channel, the message is signed with the channel's name and photo and not your own.

You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to self-destruct in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient. The message will then disappear from both your and your friend's devices. All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud.

You can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no man-in-the-middle attack can succeed. Newer versions of Telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!) when both participants are using an updated app. Always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure — it's safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the conversation partner.","Secret Chats","1","Diffie–Hellman key exchange - Wikipedia, Man-in-the-middle attack - Wikipedia"
"Telegram","https://telegram.org/faq","Why not just make all chats 'secret'?","All Telegram messages are always securely encrypted. Messages in Secret Chats use client-client encryption, while Cloud Chats use client-server/server-client encryption and are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud (more here). This enables your cloud messages to be both secure and immediately accessible from any of your devices – even if you lose your device altogether. The problem of restoring access to your chat history on a newly connected device (e.g. when you lose your phone) does not have an elegant solution in the end-to-end encryption paradigm. At the same time, reliable backups are an essential feature for any mass-market messenger. To solve this problem, some applications (like Whatsapp and Viber) allow decryptable backups that put their users' privacy at risk – even if they do not enable backups themselves. Other apps ignore the need for backups altogether and leave their users vulnerable to data loss. We opted for a third approach by offering two distinct types of chats. Telegram disables default system backups and provides all users with an integrated security-focused backup solution in the form of Cloud Chats. Meanwhile, the separate entity of Secret Chats gives you full control over the data you do not want to be stored. This allows Telegram to be widely adopted in broad circles, not just by activists and dissidents, so that the simple fact of using Telegram does not mark users as targets for heightened surveillance in certain countries. We are convinced that the separation of conversations into Cloud and Secret chats represents the most secure solution currently possible for a massively popular messaging application.

"Telegram","https://telegram.org/faq","Who can see my phone number?","On Telegram, you can send messages in private chats and groups without making your phone number visible. By default, your number is only visible to people who you've added to your address book as contacts. You can further modify this in Settings > Privacy and Security > Phone Number. Note that people will always see your number if they know it already and saved it in their address book.","Your Account","0","NA"
"Telegram","https://telegram.org/faq","I have a new phone number, what do I do?","Each phone number is a separate account on Telegram. You have several options if you are using multiple phone numbers: If you will no longer use the old number (e.g., you moved to a new country or changed your number for good), simply go to Settings and change the number connected to your Telegram account to the new number. Important: make sure you have access to your connected phone number – otherwise you risk losing access to your account. If you will use the new number for a limited time (e.g., you're on a trip or vacation), there's no need to do anything. If you want to keep using both numbers (e.g., you have a work phone and personal phone), choose one as your Telegram number. You may create another Telegram account on the second number as well, for example, if you want to keep work and personal chats separated. It is possible to log in to one Telegram app with up to 3 different accounts at once.","Your Account","1","Autoplaying Videos, Automatic Downloads and Multiple Accounts"
"Telegram","https://telegram.org/faq","How do I log out?","Most users don't need to log out of Telegram: You can use Telegram on many devices at the same time. Just use the same phone number to log in on all devices. You can go to Settings > Data and Storage > Storage Usage> Clear cache to free up space on your device without logging out. If you use Telegram with multiple phone numbers, you can switch between accounts without logging out. If you use Telegram on a shared device, you can set up a passcode in Settings > Privacy and Security to make sure only you have access to your account. If you do want to log out for some reason, here's how you do that: iOS: Go to Settings > Edit > Log out. Android, Telegram Desktop: Go to Settings > … (in the top right corner) > Log out. If you log out, you will keep all your cloud messages. However, you will lose all your Secret Chats and all messages inside those secret chats when you log out. Note that logging out does not trigger remote deletion of your secret chat messages on your partner's device — to do that, choose 'Clear History' first.","Your Account","1","switch between accounts, Multiple Accounts and More"

"Telegram","https://telegram.org/faq","How do I delete my account?","If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page. Deleting your account permanently removes all your messages and contacts. All groups and channels that you've created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their rights. This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone. We recommend using a non-mobile browser for this process. Note that you'll receive the code via Telegram, not SMS.","Your Account","1","deactivation page"
"Telegram","https://telegram.org/faq","What happens if I delete my account?","As was just mentioned above, all your data will be flushed from our system: all messages, groups, and contacts associated with your account will be deleted. That said, your contacts will still be able to chat in the groups that you have created, and they will still have their copy of the messages you sent them. So if you want to send messages that can vanish without a trace, try using our self-destruct timer instead. Termination of a Telegram account is irreversible. If you sign up again, you will appear as a new user and will not get your history, contacts or groups back. People, who have your phone number in their contacts, will be notified.

To delete individual messages or entire chats for both parties at any time, simply tap on a message (or hold to select any number of chats) and tap on the delete icon, then check the option to delete for both parties. Many relevant settings are available in Settings > Privacy & Security (on iOS, there is one more step > Data Settings), for example: To delete your Synced Contacts, choose Delete Synced Contacts. To delete your Cloud Drafts, choose Delete All Cloud Drafts (on Android, this option is in Settings > Data and Storage). To delete suggestion metadata about contacts and bots you message frequently, turn off Suggest Frequent Contacts. For other data: To delete your profile pictures, open your profile > tap on your profile picture > > Delete.

To delete your call history go to Calls > / > Delete All Calls.","Your Account","0","NA"
"Telegram","https://telegram.org/faq","My phone was stolen, what do I do?","First of all, sorry about your phone. Unfortunately, the phone number is the only way for us to identify a Telegram user at the moment. We don't collect additional information about you, so whoever has the number, has the account. This means we can't help you unless you have access either to the phone number or to Telegram itself on any of your devices. Go to Telegram Settings > Privacy and Security and turn on Two-Step Verification. This way the phone number alone will not be enough to log in to your account. Go to Settings > Devices (or Privacy & Security > Active Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device. Whoever has your phone will not be able to log in again, since they don't know your password. Contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number. If you decide to switch to a new phone number, don't forget to go to Settings, tap on your phone number and change your Telegram number to the new one. First and foremost, you need to contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number. Wait till you receive your new SIM with the old number, log in to Telegram, then go to Settings > Devices (or Privacy & Security > Active Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device. Common thieves usually throw out the SIM card immediately (the phone is harder to locate this way), then wipe the devices and sell them, so there isn't much risk for the data in case of regular petty theft. But if you have reasons to worry about the data on the device and are unable to log out the other device, it is best that you wipe it remotely. You can read more about it here: Apple iOS, Android. Unfortunately, this requires you to have prepared in advance for this scenario. You can delete your Telegram account if you are logged in on at least one of your other devices (mobile or desktop). Note that inactive Telegram accounts self-destruct automatically after a period of time — 18 months being the default setting.","Your Account","1","Effacer un appareil avec Localiser des appareils sur iCloud.com - Assistance Apple (FR), Localiser"

"Telegram","https://telegram.org/faq","What is a Passkey?","If you are already logged in to Telegram on a device, you can create a passkey that allows you to enter your Telegram account the same way you unlock your device. With a passkey, you can log in to your device simply by entering a PIN code or biometric data like your Face ID or fingerprint scan. Passkeys are an additional login method that can be used instead of SMS to instantly enter your account – even if you are traveling or don't have SMS service. Passkeys are also more secure than SMS codes, helping protect users from unauthorized access to their account.  Your passkeys can be managed in Settings > Privacy and Security > Passkeys from any app — which shows detailed info for each of your passkeys, like their creation date and when they were last used to log in. If you have a password manager like iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager or another third-party service, you can use it to back up your passkey in case you upgrade or lose access to your device. With a passkey, you can still request an SMS code in order to log in – so always make sure your account uses an up-to-date phone number that is controlled by you. For even more security, you can add an extra password to your account that is required each time you log in.","Your Account","0","NA"

They can't access your last seen status and don't see your phone number (unless you decide to give it to them yourself). Naturally, any bot should be treated as a stranger — don't give them your passwords, Telegram codes or bank account numbers, even if they ask nicely.

"Telegram","https://telegram.org/faq","Can I get Telegram's server-side code?","All Telegram client apps are fully open source. We offer verifiable builds both for iOS and Android – this technology allows to independently verify that the application you download from the app stores was built using the exact same code that we publish. By contrast, publishing the server code doesn't provide security guarantees neither for Secret Chats nor for Cloud Chats. This is because – unlike with the client-side code – there's no way to verify that the same code is run on the servers. As for Secret Chats, you don't need the server-side code to check their integrity – the point of end-to-end encryption is that it must be solid regardless of how the servers function. In a post on his channel, Pavel Durov explained why Telegram hasn't published the server code, even as a publicity stunt.

This happens when the app requests info about the camera — it isn't using the camera. Unfortunately it may look the same to the Samsung and Xiaomi permission monitors. Camera info is requested by the app when you tap on the attachment button, or start recording a video or a video message. If you do this and quickly close the app, the already initiated request may try to run asynchronously when the app is already in the background, or be sent when the system wakes up the app to show a notification about a new message. In any case, these requests are only for the camera info, the app never uses the camera itself in the background.
